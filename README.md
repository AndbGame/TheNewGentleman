# TheNewGentleman
Source code for [The New Gentleman](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104215) mod on nexus.

I am not a lawyer and modifying a license is not a simple task. So I simply say it here, khowing that legally 
it is void, but hoping that we never get to a point that I would need to consider talking to lawyers 
for the reasons below: 
  1) I do not allow any piece of this code to be used or published on websites that support pedophilia. 
     NEXUS, VECTOR and LL are fine, for the rest just ask.
  2) I do not alllow or support any content which may include rape and/or sexual interactions between a
     creature (ActorTypeCreature) and NPCs.
  3) I do not allow software developed using code from this repository to be sold, or to be put behind a
     paywall, patron, etc.

You might see that my coding style is not matching other developers, as primarily, I'm not a C++ developer. 
If you see any issues with the code, please raise it and I would try to solve it as fast as I can.
